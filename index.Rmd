### Welcome to the repository of the crash course (3h) in web scraping.

You can find the slides in [html](articles/2024_EconomIA_webscraping.html) or [pdf](articles/2024_EconomIA_webscraping.pdf).

The webpage I/we created during the class is in the [website](https://github.com/lrberge/2024_webscraping/tree/main/website) folder (web page [here](website/index.html)). 
To publish online the websites we all created, have a look at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): you can publish a website by drag-and-dropping your folder in about 5s! (That's pretty impressive tbh.)

Finally the small exercise with the Members of the European Parliament is in the file [webscraping.py](https://github.com/lrberge/2024_webscraping/tree/main/sources).

I hope you enjoyed the class as much as I did. Have fun now!
