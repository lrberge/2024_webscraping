# Econom'IA 2024: Web scraping crash course

Welcome to the repository of the crash course (3h) in web scraping.

You can find the slides in [html](https://lrberge.github.io/2024_webscraping/articles/2024_EconomIA_webscraping.html) or [pdf](2024_EconomIA_webscraping.pdf).

The webpage I/we created during the class is in the [website](website/) folder (web page [here](https://lrberge.github.io/2024_webscraping/website/index.html)). 
To publish online the websites we all created, have a look at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): you can publish a website by drag-and-dropping your folder in about 5s! (That's pretty impressive tbh.)

Finally the small exercise with the Member of the European Parliamenent is in the file [webscraping.py](webscraping.py).

I hope you enjoyed the class as much as I did and that you've got the key concepts. Have fun now!
